reverse chronological order.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<h3>Version ${project.version} @ ${timestamp} </h3>

<h4>Source and Documentation Contributors</h4>

*   Jonathan Knight, Brian Oliver

<h4>Global and Cross-Module Changes</h4>

*   [COHINC-33](http://java.net/jira/browse/COHINC-33): Upgraded to use JUnit 4.10
    and Hamcrest 1.3

*   [COHINC-42](http://java.net/jira/browse/COHINC-42): Upgraded to use Oracle Tools 0.0.9

<h4>coherence-common</h4>

*   [COHINC-18](http://java.net/jira/browse/COHINC-18): Resolved incorrect
    PortableObject.writeExternal(...) implementation for the
    `StaticFactoryClassSchemeBasedParameterizedBuilder` class.

*   [COHINC-29](http://java.net/jira/browse/COHINC-29): Improved `LifecycleAwareEvent`
    information when using a `NonBlockingFiniteStateMachine`.

    This is a **breaking** change for the `LifecycleAwareEvent` interface.  However
    as we are only using this interface **only** with in an inner class of
    `NonBlockingFiniteStateMachine`, it **does not** break any public interfaces.

*   [COHINC-35](http://java.net/jira/browse/COHINC-35): Corrected use of printf
    in the `Runner` class that may prevent examples running on some platforms
    (like Windows).

*   [COHINC-38](http://java.net/jira/browse/COHINC-38): Enhanced ConfigurableCacheFactory
    Tests.

<h4>coherence-commandpattern</h4>

*   [COHINC-34](http://java.net/jira/browse/COHINC-34): Added missing pof-type
    declaration for the `CommandBatch` class.

*   [COHINC-48](http://java.net/jira/browse/COHINC-48): Refactored calls to
    CacheFactory.ensureCluster() that prevent redeployment in a Container.

<h4>coherence-messagingpattern</h4>

*   [COHINC-28](http://java.net/jira/browse/COHINC-28): Migrated Functional Test
    from internal Oracle Testing Framework.  These are contained in the new
    coherence-messagingpattern-tests module.

*   [COHINC-37](http://java.net/jira/browse/COHINC-37): Changed JMS Dependency
    to one that includes a jar artifact.

<h4>coherence-pushreplicationpattern</h4>

*   [COHINC-19](http://java.net/jira/browse/COHINC-19): Fixed Active-Active
    Push Replication Example - now correctly terminates.

*   [COHINC-30](http://java.net/jira/browse/COHINC-30): Removed hardcoded logging
    path from Push Replication tests.

<h4>coherence-pushreplicationpattern-web-example</h4>

*   [COHINC-40](http://java.net/jira/browse/COHINC-40): Introduced the Coherence*Web
    Examples.

<h3>Version 11.0.0 @ 2013-02-26 15:05</h3>

<h4>Source and Documentation Contributors</h4>

*   Noah Arliss, Jonathan Knight, Paul Mackin, Brian Oliver, Patrick Peralta

<h4>Global and Cross-Module Changes</h4>

*   Refactored all of the modules into a single source tree, with 
    separate folders for each module and their associated examples.
    
*   Restructured all of the modules follow standard [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) 
    conventions.
    
*   Completely re-wrote the build system to use [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/)
    instead of Apache Ant.
    
*   Ratified and released all of the modules under a standard open source 
    license (CDDL).  This included changing all file headers to use standard
    CDDL headers.  Templates for these headers are available in the 
    "documents" folder.
    
*   Formalized the mechanism and process for accepting contributions.

*   Completely migrated the existing "closed" Atlassian Confluence-based 
    documentation to be part of the source tree, thus enabling contributions.
    This included re-writing and updating parts of the documentation for this
    release.  The documentation can be found in the `coherence-incubator-site` 
    module.
    
*   Rationalized all modules to use a single Coherence Incubator version number
    instead of individual version numbers.
       
*   Migrated the source repository to [GitHub](http://github.com).

*   Migrated the [Issue Tracking](http://java.net/jira/browse/COHINC) to
    [java.net](http://java.net).

*   Introduced "uber" jar generation support to produce the entire Oracle
    Coherence Incubator in a single jar.

*   Introduced (extracted) individual "example" modules for the patterns
    instead of using a single large example module.

*   Introduced a dependency on the Oracle Tools project for tests. Re-wrote all
    process-based tests to use this package.  This work was originally part of
    the Oracle Coherence Incubator but is now a separate project.  This work
    now includes signficiant contributions from the "Grid Man" project
    (developed by Jonathan Knight). 

*   Upgraded projects to use Oracle Coherence 3.7.1.7

*   Migrated binary distribution mechanism to use [maven.java.net](http://maven.java.net)
    instead of download links.

<h4>coherence-incubator-all</h4>

*   Introduced the ability to generate a coherence-incubator-all-x.y.z.jar
    that contains all of the Oracle Coherence Incubator compiled modules
    without third-party libraries and without Oracle Coherence itself.  This
    allows developers to use a single jar file in applications instead of 
    having to specify individual jars.

<h4>coherence-incubator-site (Documentation)</h4>

*   Introduced during the migration and re-write of the original Oracle
    Coherence Incubator 10 web-based documentation from http://oracle.coherence.com/.

<h4>coherence-common</h4>

*   Refactored the implementation of the Finite State Machines to correctly
    adopt and use standard UML terminology.

<h4>coherence-commandpattern</h4>

*   No Changes

<h4>coherence-commandpattern-examples</h4>

*   Introduced by extracting examples from Oracle Coherence Incubator 10.

<h4>coherence-functorpattern</h4>

*   No Changes

<h4>coherence-functorpattern-examples</h4>

*   Introduced by extracting examples from Oracle Coherence Incubator 10.

<h4>coherence-processingpattern</h4>

*   No Changes

<h4>coherence-processingpattern-examples</h4>

*   Introduced by extracting examples from Oracle Coherence Incubator 10.

<h4>coherence-messagingpattern</h4>

*   Resolved potential Message memory leak 
    (messages not being removed from the messages cache after being acknowledged)

<h4>coherence-eventdistributionpattern</h4>

*   Resolved potential and unnecessary hi-cpu usage when using 
    Coherence-based Messaging distributors.

*   Refactored tests to use Oracle Tools.

*   Introduced the new `ParallelLocalCacheEventChannel` providing the ability
    to update local caches in parallel across a cluster.

<h4>coherence-pushreplicationpattern</h4>

*   Refactored tests to use Oracle Tools.

*   Resolved issue were calling NamedCache.getAll(...) on a cache that is being
    used for Push Replication would throw an UnsupportedOperationException.

*   Added new tests for the new `ParallelLocalCacheEventChannel`.

<h4>coherence-pushreplicationpattern-examples</h4>

*   Introduced by extracting examples from Oracle Coherence Incubator 10.
